This is a simple sort-of Forth system for AVR microcontrollers. It's
written for the Pololu Baby Orangutan robot controller [1]

Most of the documentation is in the form of comments in the source file
avrvm.rst and the system in general probably won't make much sense unless
you're already at least a little familiar with Forth.

There's no attempt to implement or adhere to any standard Forth. I'm just
noodling around and creating the easiest version of what seems like it
will work.

Knowledge and inspiration came from myriad sources but especially
noteworthy are: Brad Rodriguez' "Moving Forth" series [2] and Richard
Jones' wonderful jonesforth "literate Forth" [3].

You can use docutils' rst2html command to convert the ReST file to HTML,
and the rest2asm.py script (which depends on docutils and BeautifulSoup)
to convert it to asm for assembly to a hex file and flashing to a chip.
